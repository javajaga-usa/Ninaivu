# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

The first cut of Ninaivu as a product, carried forward from Hearth 2.0.0 (with
the fixes of the 28 September 2026 code review) under a new name.

- The package, the settings, the environment variables (`NINAIVU_*`), the state
  directory (`~/.ninaivu`) and the mDNS name (`ninaivu.local`) all carry the new
  name. There is no upgrade path from a Hearth state directory in this release.
- The Cloud tab is **Mugil** and the photo editor is **Sudar**.
- The Windows, macOS and shell launchers are gone; `launcher/start.py`, Docker and the
  service examples under `installers/` are the ways to run it until the
  installers in the roadmap exist.
- The household-specific documents, audits and the illustrated PDF guide were
  not carried over.
- Python 3.12 is the floor.
- **Google Photos comes across whole.** Importing a Takeout export already
  took the dates from its JSON sidecars; now the location (often the only
  place it survives, since the export strips it from many files) and the
  description typed under a photograph go into the index too, and the
  albums come back: once the archive is in the library, the Import page
  offers to make every album folder it found as an album, from the copies
  the import kept, without reading the export a second time.
- **The first day.** Right after the administrator is made, the console
  walks through the five things a new library needs — the folder, the
  household, what the scan works out by itself, a copy outside the house,
  the address for the phones — each step skippable, each using the page's
  own routes. It opens once; an established library never sees it.
- **Remote access is a choice, not an assumption.** Server → Away from home
  picks Tailscale, WireGuard (with its subnets), a Cloudflare Tunnel, the
  household's own reverse proxy, or nothing; each says what it still needs.
  Which addresses count as away from home, which are listed for the
  household, and whose certificate is served all follow the choice. The
  default works out Tailscale by itself, as before.
- **An update check.** Once a day Ninaivu asks GitHub's releases page whether
  a newer version is out — one plain request with nothing about this computer
  in it — and the Server page says so with a link. A switch there turns it off.
- **The console says only what is true on this machine.** Each AI switch
  shows the model it needs and whether it is installed, with a link to it;
  the search box promises "last summer", which a calendar reads, and not a
  place name until place names are on; every Overview card opens the page
  behind its number; Live Photos and On This Day appear in the family sidebar
  only once there is something behind them.
- **Ninaivu's own mark**: a roof over a photograph, drawn in code
  (`tools/generate_icons.py`), in every size and splash screen.
- **A tour of the screens** (`docs/screens.md`): every page pictured from a
  generated sample library, with what it is for. The Overview puts "Needs
  you" — the queues, counted — above the numbers, and the safety checks
  point at the Health page they are about.
- **A tidy root.** `start.cmd` is the one file at the root besides what Git,
  GitHub and pip need there. The launcher is `launcher/start.py` (with
  `start.sh` beside it), the pins are under `requirements/`, and the
  changelog, roadmap, contributing and security notes are under `docs/`.
- **The console, arranged by what each page is for.** Every switch sits on
  the page of the thing it governs: the rules for everyone (who may browse
  without signing in, what is screened, how far back each role sees) open the
  Visibility page; indexing is on Library settings; the AI passes (places,
  text, faces, video moments) are on AI models beside the models they use;
  System → Settings keeps this home's name, the extensions and what is
  installed. Restoring from the cloud copy has its own page under Backup &
  health, apart from the everyday Mugil page. Library comes straight after
  Home in the sidebar, with Library settings as its first page.
- **Extensions.** `ninaivu/extensions.py` finds extension packages through the
  `ninaivu.extensions` entry point; the console lists them under AI models →
  Extensions with what each sends off the machine, and every one is off until
  an administrator turns it on. **Gemini is the first**, moved out of the core
  into `extensions/gemini/`. Sudar's generate route no longer falls back to
  Gemini when no local model is installed: a request that names no provider
  stays on this machine.
