# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

The first cut of Ninaivu as a product, carried forward from Hearth 2.0.0 (with
the fixes of the 28 September 2026 code review) under a new name.

- The package, the settings, the environment variables (`NINAIVU_*`), the state
  directory (`~/.ninaivu`) and the mDNS name (`ninaivu.local`) all carry the new
  name. There is no upgrade path from a Hearth state directory in this release.
- The Cloud tab is **Mugil** and the photo editor is **Sudar**.
- The Windows, macOS and shell launchers are gone; `start.py`, Docker and the
  service examples under `installers/` are the ways to run it until the
  installers in the roadmap exist.
- The household-specific documents, audits and the illustrated PDF guide were
  not carried over.
- Python 3.12 is the floor.
- **The console, arranged by what each page is for.** Every switch sits on
  the page of the thing it governs: the rules for everyone (who may browse
  without signing in, what is screened, how far back each role sees) open the
  Visibility page; indexing is on Library settings; the AI passes (places,
  text, faces, video moments) are on AI models beside the models they use;
  System → Settings keeps this home's name, the extensions and what is
  installed. Restoring from the cloud copy has its own page under Backup &
  health, apart from the everyday Mugil page.
- **Extensions.** `ninaivu/extensions.py` finds extension packages through the
  `ninaivu.extensions` entry point; the console lists them under AI models →
  Extensions with what each sends off the machine, and every one is off until
  an administrator turns it on. **Gemini is the first**, moved out of the core
  into `extensions/gemini/`. Sudar's generate route no longer falls back to
  Gemini when no local model is installed: a request that names no provider
  stays on this machine.
